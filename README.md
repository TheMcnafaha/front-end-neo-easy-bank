## My process

This is the second time I try this Challenge. The first time I tried my usual go to media-query approach were I built the entire website in a mobile media-query; then I build the longer/tablet webiste;
and last I build the desktop website. However, the CSS used to make the images move around, grow, and crop, required significantly more time to get right. So this time I built "section by section".
I got the intro part (the one with the img magic) first as mobile, then as tablet, and last as desktop. Ignoring the rest of the site until the intro was 90% of the way there and then moved on to the next
section and repeating the same steps I took with the previous one. I found this method to be a lot better since it maintained my focus on each section of the website instead of revisiting parts after
the fact.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io/) - JS library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/) - Tailwind component Library

### What I learned

I learned that the new process I used is cool and that grid is magical.
